## Run Game Locally

Please open index.html in a browser

## Instructions

Click on two cards to try to match the symbols. If they do not match the cards will shake red and then flip back over. If the cards do match the cards will pulse blue and the cards will remain out. Match all of the cards to win.

## What to Expect

The goal of the game is to match all the cards as quickly as possible. The game starts you out with 3 stars, the more moves you make the more stars you'll lose. So try your best to keep all of those stars!
